# About

The Condor is out classed by the Colossus in almost every way. The Condor compared to the Colossus has, 

* 1 less medium dock
* 2 less small docks
* Better Dock Layout
* One less XL Shield
* Way less turrets
* No shields for its engine
* A little more agility
* More cargo space
* More missile capacity

This mod seeks to make the Condor worth while by, 

* Adding one more XL shield. 
* Moves its L Turret Up Front
* Adding 3 Medium Shields To The Engine Group

This means while the Condor still does not have as much fire power as a Colossus it has a fair bit more shielding.

# What Is Modified?

* The Condor layout file

# Notes

* Existing Condors will all loose their Large Turrets. Will need to be replaced because existing turrets cannot be moved, only removed.
